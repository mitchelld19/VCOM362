				<h2>Long Range Drones</h2>
				<div class="one-drone-type">
					<div id="longRangeDroneImg"></div>
					<p>Personal radio-controlled drones are becoming exceedingly common in today&rsquo;s market. For hobbyists and newcomers alike, drones offer a unique new way to approach RC flight and allow users to capture sights that weren&rsquo;t possible on their own. So, it&rsquo;s no wonder every other drone comes with a payload capacity or ability to attach a GoPro camera to its frame . Video and photographs from previously impossible angles are created, meaning there&rsquo;s more incentive for enthusiasts beyond piloting a small machine.</p>
					<p>Beyond how long they can remain in the sky, however, drones do have some limitations. Finding out which drone in which price tier has the least amount of limitations is the key to enjoying the hobby to its fullest. In this case, it&rsquo;s about range. Since drones are remote controlled they need a signal to respond to from the pilot&rsquo;s point. Good drones can still hold steady hundreds, if not thousands of feet, away. Lesser models will likely falter after about a few hundred feet or less.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="one-drone-type">
					<h3>DJI Phantom 3 Quadcopter (Standard version)</h3>
					<p>DJI and its respective fleet often find their units on our list for having a pretty lengthy variety of models to choose from. That, and the hardware in question has a lot to offer. Previously the Phantom 3 was also on our list of drones with the longest battery life, because it sported a whopping 20 minutes. Let&rsquo;s add to that, as the Phantom 3 has been recorded to hit distances of about 500 meters, or 1500 feet. That manes enthusiasts can get some really amazing sky shots while the Phantom 3 does its thing. The basic unit, which lacks an extra batter and such, sits close to $500 USD, making it a decent long range quadcopter for sale in this tier.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="one-drone-type">
					<h3>Xiro Xplorer V</h3>
					<p>If the name didn&rsquo;t already imply it, the designers really want you to understand the &ldquo;X&rdquo; is a major feature here. Even the drone has an x like shape. More to the point, as a long range drone with camera, and it&rsquo;s heavy $560 USD pricetag, one expects some performance. Well, it does deliver at least in principle, with a bulky sky life of 20 minutes. But, emphasizing flight range, our x-loving drone gets around on 1800 feet ranges, or 600 meters. From there, you can capture all its sported 1080p video you want. Xiro Xplorer V is FPV drone by all means. Video transmission works very well, better than I expected to be honest. There&rsquo;s updated version of this drone available now (Xiro Xplorer 2) which looks very futuristic. That also means this version is now on sale, so get&nbsp;your piece right now!</p>
				</div>
				<div class="one-drone-type">
					<h3>Blade Chroma</h3>
					<p>This great looking drone deserved it&rsquo;s place on this list. It&rsquo;s not only one of the drones with best flight range in this price range but it&rsquo;s also one of the best drones for aerial photography and videography in this price range because of it&rsquo;s stability, reliability and SAFE technology Blade putted into it.&nbsp;Using solely a remote control for operation, the Chroma can be flown up to 400 meters (1,312 feet) away from you. Compared to the average controllable range of 100 meters, you can control the Chroma from 300 meters (984 feet) further away. That&rsquo;s not where the party ends. There are several versions of Chroma, some of them supports GoPro Hero 3 and 4 action cameras, while one version(on the picture) comes with it&rsquo;s own camera. Both are great quality but buying one that works with GoPro can save you some money in case you already have GoPro camera.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="one-drone-type">
					<h3>Yuneec Q500+ Typhoon</h3>
					<p>The Typhoon is on this list again for all around impressiveness. In our article about drones with long flight times, we were already liking its considerable half-hour sky life. The facts don&rsquo;t change though, and the Typhoon has an RC range of about 8000 feet, according to reports. At $700 USD that might be one of the better deals you can get. In this tier, it also makes it one of the best long range camera drones you can find. Granted, the area you&rsquo;re in might affect this lengthy range, but overall it can get places for the photo/drone enthusiast. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with Q500 if you&rsquo;re looking for long distance drone that&rsquo;s capable to record high quality video and capture amazing photos.</p>
