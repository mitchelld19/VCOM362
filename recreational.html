				<h2 id="recreational-use">What is Recreational Use of sUAS?</h2>
				<p id="recreational-desc">The recreational use of sUAS is the operation of an unmanned aircraft for personal interests and enjoyment. For example, using a sUAS to take photographs for your own personal use would be considered recreational; using the same device to take photographs or videos for compensation or sale to another individual would be considered a commercial operation. You should check with the FAA for further determination as to what constitutes commercial or other non-hobby, non-recreational sUAS operations.</p>

					<h2>What are the safety guidelines for sUAS recreational users?</h2>
					<ul class="step-bullets">
						<li>Follow community-based safety guidelines, as developed by organizations such as the Academy of Model Aeronautics (AMA).</li>
						<li>Fly no higher than 400 feet and remain below any surrounding obstacles when possible.</li>
						<li>Keep your sUAS in eyesight at all times, and use an observer to assist if needed.</li>
						<li>Remain well clear of and do not interfere with manned aircraft operations, and you must see and avoid other aircraft and obstacles at all times.</li>
						<li>Do not intentionally fly over unprotected persons or moving vehicles, and remain at least 25 feet away from individuals and vulnerable property.</li>
						<li>Contact the airport and control tower before flying within five miles of an airport or heliport. (Read about best practices here)</li>
						<li>Do not fly in adverse weather conditions such as in high winds or reduced visibility.</li>
						<li>Do not fly under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</li>
						<li>Ensure the operating environment is safe and that the operator is competent and proficient in the operation of the sUAS.</li>
						<li>Do not fly near or over sensitive infrastructure or property such as power stations, water treatment facilities, correctional facilities, heavily traveled roadways, government facilities, etc.</li>
						<li>Check and follow all local laws and ordinances before flying over private property.</li>
						<li>Do not conduct surveillance or photograph persons in areas where there is an expectation of privacy without the individual&rsquo;s permission (see AMA&rsquo;s privacy policy).</li>

				<h2>Where Can I Fly?</h2>
				<p>If you&rsquo;re asking yourself this question, have no fear, the FAA is working diligently to make sure every pilot understands where it&rsquo;s okay to fly, and where it&rsquo;s not. FAA aeronautical maps are awesome for experienced pilots, but without a background in aviation, they&rsquo;re almost impossible to understand.</p>
				<p>The FAA knows this and started a campaign last year culminating in their no-fly zone map. Here are the three big no-no&rsquo;s:</p>
				<ul id="NoFlyBullets">
				<li>Major Airports</li>
				<li>U.S. Military Bases</li>
				<li>U.S. National Parks</li>
				</ul>
				<div id="noDroneSiteImg"></div>
				<p>They haven&rsquo;t stopped there though. The FAA is also spending $43,000 to develop an app, known as B4UFly; it will initially be released on iOS and later on Android. It&rsquo;s scheduled for beta this summer and full release in the fall of 2015.</p>
				<p>The app will notify pilots if they&rsquo;re flying in a restricted zone, allow drone enthusiasts to plan future flights, and connect users with nearby airports to ensure they&rsquo;re far enough away. Below is the preliminary design.</p>
				<p>Another great resource is MapBox.  To help people find safe places to fly, they mapped established no-fly areas where drones are not permitted around all major airports, military bases, and national parks across the country.
