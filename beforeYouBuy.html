				<h2>Not All drones Are Easy To Fly</h2>
				<div class="beforeYouBuy-section">
					<p>If you want to buy a drone, you should first know that anything that flies is going to be hard to control. A typical quadcopter is actually physically impossible to fly, but what keeps it stable is the computer inside (typically called the flight controller). Every drone flies slightly different depending on how the flight controller is setup. Some flight controllers are setup for more agile flying, while others might be geared more towards stability.</p>
					<p>When it comes to flying and skill level, there&rsquo;s this magical price curve that nobody really talks about. I call it the &ldquo;price vs ease-of-use curve&rdquo;. Normally, with radio control cars, planes or helicopters when the price goes up, the difficulty level increases. However, with drones that isn&rsquo;t the case. Here&rsquo;s a simple graph to illustrate what I&rsquo;m talking about. The ease-of-use value goes from 0 to 10 and the price value goes from $0 to $1,000. Looking at the graph you can see that the easiest drones to fly are in the $700 range. The reason why more expensive drones fly better is because of the added sensors and functionality to the flight controllers inside.</p>

				<h2>Not all are ready to fly</h2>
				<div class="beforeYouBuy-section">
					<p>When you&rsquo;re looking at drones to buy, you&rsquo;ll see a few common acronyms that pop up, RTF, BNF, and ARF.</p>
					<ul class="step-bullets">
						<li>RTF stands for Ready-To-Fly. Usually, an RTF quadcopter doesn&rsquo;t require any assembly or setup, but you may have to do some simple things like charge up the battery, install the propellers or bind the controller to the quadcopter (get them talking to each other).</li>
						<li>BNF stands for Bind-And-Fly. A BNF quadcopter usually comes completely assembled, but without a controller. With BNF models, you&rsquo;ll have to use the controller that you already have (if it&rsquo;s compatible) or find a controller sold separately. One thing you should know is that, just because a transmitter and receiver are on the same frequency that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;ll work together. In the analog days, if you had a transmitter and receiver both running on the same frequency they were almost guaranteed to work together. Now with digital communication that&rsquo;s all changed. Even If your transmitter and receiver are on the same channel, they must use the same manufacture protocol in order to talk to each other. So check to make sure that your controller will work with your drone before buying it.</li>
						<li>ARF stands for Almost-ready-to-fly. ARF quadcopters are usually like quadcopter kits. They usually don&rsquo;t come with a transmitter or receiver and might require partial assembly. An ARF drone kit might also leave out components like motors, ESCs, or even the flight controller and battery. The definition of an ARF drone kit is very broad, so whenever you see ARF in the title, you should read the description thoroughly.</li>

				<h2>Cheaper drones aren't necessarily for beginners</h2>
				<div class="beforeYouBuy-section">	
					<p>Like many things in life, you get what you pay for with drones: The more money you spend, the more features you get that make flying easier. For example, DJI's Phantom 3 Standard, while a good choice for its current $500 price and certainly not a bad starting point, lacks sensors found on the higher-end Advanced and Professional versions to help it hover in place when indoors or without a GPS lock.</p>
					<p>If you're just starting out, GPS is invaluable and worth paying more for if you're looking for stable flying out of the box, especially for photos and video. GPS is something you won't typically find on toy-grade drones, and although they're good to practice with, new pilots might find toy drones to be incredibly frustrating.</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Flight times are relatively short</h2>
				<div class="beforeYouBuy-section">		
					<p>Battery life is still the suck when it comes to drones. DJI is promising up to 28 minutes for its Phantom 4, which is long for the category. The average for camera drones is around 20 minutes or less. Toy drones typically get between 5 and 7 minutes of good flying, though some can hit the 10-to-12-minute range.</p>
					<p>While there are solutions in the works from companies such as Intelligent Energy with its hydrogen fuel cells, a drone maker actually has to adopt the technology to make it available to consumers. Note, too, that when a manufacturer gives you a "flight time" that it reached that time under ideal testing conditions in a controlled environment. The faster you fly, the more weight you add, the stronger the winds you're flying in, the quicker the drone will sap its battery.</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Some days are not good for flying</h2>
				<div class="beforeYouBuy-section">			
					<p>When you get your new drone, the urge to unpack it, put it together, and send it aloft will be extremely compelling but if the weather isn&rsquo;t ideal, then you stand a good chance of losing your new UAS.</p>
					<p>As such, you should only fly when conditions are clear and winds are calm. Drones are designed to be very light and are subject to the slightest breeze. You&rsquo;re not going to be fighting for control in calm conditions but you will have to make course corrections and as such, the calmer it is the more fun and less worry you will have.</p>
					<p>Also, you shouldn&rsquo;t fly in low light or darkened conditions. When it&rsquo;s dark, you may be able to see the drone, due to its lights, but that&rsquo;s about it. You&rsquo;re not going to be able to see where you&rsquo;re flying and what you&rsquo;re flying around, so when all is said and done, fly when it is light out.</p>
					<p>Of course, it goes without saying but we&rsquo;ll say it anyway, while drinking and droning may seem like it would be a lot of fun, you should take their operation soberly. If the recent event in Washington DC is any indication, this is an excellent rule to observe. Wait until after you&rsquo;ve successfully flown your drone and safely packed it away before celebrating.</p>

				<h2>You may need to make an investment upfront</h2>
				<div class="beforeYouBuy-section">
					<p>If you just want something to fly around the house then this section doesn&rsquo;t really apply to you, but if you&rsquo;re looking at spending hundreds (maybe even thousands) of pounds then you need to invest your time and money wisely.</p>
					<ul class="step-bullets">
						<li>Invest in a good controller. Getting a good controller is one of the best investments you can make. Controllers (unlike smartphones) don&rsquo;t get outdated very quickly, so if you&rsquo;re planning on being in the hobby for a while, you&rsquo;re going to want to get a controller that will last at least a couple years. Some people that have been using the same controller for over 10 years. The reason why you can make one last so long is because the &ldquo;transmitter&rdquo; part is removable so that you can upgrade it to work with different or newer communication technologies in the future.</li>
						<li>Buy a good charger. I know it seems crazy to spend a lot of money for a battery charger, but just like with your controller, a good charger is going to last for years. Cheap chargers that come with RTF drone kits usually charge slow, are not very reliable, and can usually only charge the battery that they come with (nothing bigger). The more expensive chargers can charge pretty much any battery you can think of, from lithium polymer to lead acid.</li>
						<li>Invest in research. I know that buying your first drone is exciting, but it&rsquo;s not something you should rush. The more research you do, the more knowledge you&rsquo;ll gain, and eventually, you&rsquo;ll start to understand the differences between all of the drone parts out there and the reasons why one part might be better than the&nbsp;other.</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>There are a ton of places to buy from</h2>
				<div class="beforeYouBuy-section">
					<p>If you don&rsquo;t know where to buy a drone, don&rsquo;t worry. There&rsquo;s tons of online stores for drones that will deliver to just about any major country. Most of the big online drone retailers are located in either the USA or China, but if you look hard enough you might be able to find a smaller store in the UK.</p>
					<p>One of the biggest stores (if not the biggest) is called Hobby King. Hobby King is like the Tesco of radio control. They have tens of thousands of products for sale. Some products are things that they&rsquo;ve designed themselves, some are things that they&rsquo;ve gotten permission to manufacture and other things they just sell like any other retailer. Make sure you read the reviews of whatever the part is that you&rsquo;re looking at. That way, you can see if people have had any problems and whether or not it&rsquo;s a good product.</p>
					<p>Another place to look for parts and even full drone setups is the Classifieds section of RCGroups.com. The Classifieds section of RCGroups is like the craigslist of radio control stuff. You can find amazing deals, but you can also get scammed and ripped off. So be careful who you buy from on there. I would say about 95% of the people on there are ok to buy from, just watch out for the other 5% and you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
					<p>Below you will find all of the main websites for buying drones. All of the sites near the top of the list are what I consider great places to buy from. The websites near the bottom of the list are sites that I&rsquo;ve heard about but don&rsquo;t have a lot of knowledge or experience with.</p>

				<h2>You should join a drone community</h2>
				<div class="beforeYouBuy-section">
					<p>If you want to be a serious drone hobbyist, you may want to consider becoming part of a community of some kind. There are tons of online drone forums out there. Some are for general purpose and some or for very specific subjects, like a certain product line or part. You don&rsquo;t have to join every drone forum you find, but we recommend finding at least one or two and seeing how you like them.</p>
					<p>Drone forums can be great, but you have to know what it is that you&rsquo;re trying to ask, where to ask and how to ask it. If you don&rsquo;t, your questions will go unanswered. Sometimes people will even look down on you, just because you asked a stupid question. If you&rsquo;ve never been part of an online forum before, just join one and look at how other people are asking&nbsp;questions.</p>
